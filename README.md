## Project URL

[Roadmap Markdown Note-taking App](https://roadmap.sh/projects/markdown-note-taking-app)

## Requirements

You will need PHP (V8 or higher) and MySQL to use this app. I reccomend you XAMPP to use this app.

Additionally, you need to install a spellchecker on your system. Aspell is the recommended option. You can find more information about how to install it [here](https://tigitz.github.io/php-spellchecker/docs/spellcheckers/aspell.html)
